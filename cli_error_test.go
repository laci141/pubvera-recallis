// The CLI explains itself on stderr and exits non-zero: an unknown command
// prints its whole usage text, its version banner, and on a network failure
// whatever the upstream API said, all unbounded. runCLI captures that and logs
// it, which is right. What it must not do is put it in the error it returns,
// because writeCLIError writes that error straight into the HTTP response body
// for every endpoint.
//
// This test drives the real handler with a stub CLI that behaves the way the
// real one does on failure, and asserts on what the client receives.

// stubStderr is what the fake CLI writes to stderr before failing. It stands in
// for the real CLI's usage banner: distinctive enough that finding any part of
// it in an HTTP body is unambiguous.
